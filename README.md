# My-ToDo-List-React-App
The ToDo List App helps the user input the items they want to complete and helps track the progress
The user can input their list of items and can cross each item when done, just like on paper, to indicate the completion of tasks.
The user can also delete the items from the list incase of a wrongful entry or when done with the item of the list
The App also tracks the number of items on the app and keeps track of the total and completed items on the list
